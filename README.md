Project for a computermusic seminar about SuperCollider and SonicPi.

This projects goal is to create visualization and sonification of algorithms using Processing and SuperCollider.
A good example is this video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg&t=36s
While in the video there are only sorting algorithms, other algorithms like Dijkstra and A* should also be included in this project.

If possible, the sonification should be independent of the algorithm and visual implementation. This will ultimately - as far as I can see - lead to parsing, analyzing and rewriting of the Processing source code to include SuperCollider calls.

Firstly, I am going to make some basic visualization of different algorithms and sonificate them with SuperCollider by using  the network protocol OSC. So to say, I will first do what in the end the "compiling" algorithm should do by itself.

# algosound
Project for a computermusic seminar.

This projects goal is to create visualization and sonification of algorithms using Processing and SuperCollider.
A good example is this video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg&t=36s
While in the video there are only sorting algorithms, other algorithms like Dijkstra and A* should also be included in this project.

If possible, the sonification should be independent of the algorithm and visual implementation. This will ultimately - as far as I can see - lead to parsing, analyzing and rewriting of the algorithm implementation to include SuperCollider calls.
